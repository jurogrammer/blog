# Module Overview
- Module name: blog-site
- Responsibility: Deliver blog content and static utility pages via Hugo and client-side assets.
- Dependencies (internal + external): `content/**`, `layouts/**`, `static/**`, `hugo.toml`, GitHub Actions workflow, PaperMod theme.

# Internal Architecture
- Package structure: Content-first Hugo layout with section folders under `content/`, template overrides under `layouts/`, static artifacts under `static/`; Team Generator assets live in `static/tools/team-generator/`.
- Key classes/components: Hugo page templates/partials, page front matter, browser scripts for interactive tools; Team Generator uses `parser.js` (category parsing), `shuffle.js`, `allocator.js` (category round-robin), `storage.js` (schema v2), `render.js`, `app.js`.
- Domain model summary: Content pages (posts/tool pages) rendered into static HTML with optional client-state in browser storage.

# APIs (If applicable)
- Endpoints: Static routes generated by Hugo (no server API endpoints), including `/tools/team-generator/`.
- DTO contracts: Not applicable.
- External integrations: GitHub Pages hosting and GitHub Actions build pipeline.

# Data
- Tables / Collections owned: None (no backend persistence).
- Schema notes: Tool state persisted in `localStorage` using scoped keys (`team-generator.state` for Team Generator categories/options/results). Schema v2 stores category id/title/text arrays.
- Migration strategy: Version localStorage payloads via `version` field when structure changes.

# Configuration
- Required env vars: None for runtime; CI uses `HUGO_ENVIRONMENT=production`.
- Module-specific configs: `hugo.toml` defines `baseURL`, theme, menus, markup.

# Runtime
- How to run this module locally: `hugo server` from repository root.
- Ports: Default Hugo dev server (`1313`) unless overridden.
- Profiles: Development (`hugo server`) and production build (`hugo --minify`).

# Module Conventions
- Module-specific patterns: For tools, keep behavior in standalone JS files and avoid framework/runtime dependencies.
- Error boundaries: Keep UI operable on invalid input and display inline validation text.
- Validation rules: Parse category input robustly (newline/comma delimiters inside each category, trimming, empty-entry filtering, optional global duplicate removal).

# Assumptions / Decisions
- This repository is treated as a single module until additional independently deployable modules are introduced.
- Tool pages should not rely on server-side runtime logic beyond static Hugo rendering.
- Team Generator styles are namespaced with `tg-` classes to avoid collision with PaperMod global styles.
- In Team Generator, category 1 block is always present (not removable), and additional category blocks are user-managed dynamically.

# Known Issues
- Local environments may miss `hugo` CLI and require temporary binary download for render checks.

# Change Log (Last 10)
- 2026-02-16: Simplified Team Generator textarea sizing CSS by removing redundant per-category `min-height` declaration.
- 2026-02-16: Standardized category textarea min-height at `84px` across both category-specific and shared textarea selectors.
- 2026-02-16: Corrected textarea sizing by reducing shared `.tg-layout-settings textarea` min-height to match compact category-entry design.
- 2026-02-16: Tuned category member textarea size by lowering minimum height for denser category entry UI.
- 2026-02-16: Reworked Team Generator form to dynamic category blocks (`+ Add Category`, per-category title/edit/delete) and replaced flat allocation with category-based round-robin distribution.
- 2026-02-16: Updated Team Generator form UI colors by forcing white form-control backgrounds and native-like gray borders; dataset selector now renders as enabled to match reference visuals.
- 2026-02-16: Implemented Team Generator page (`content/tools/team-generator/index.md`) with dedicated layout and modular vanilla JS/CSS under `static/tools/team-generator/`.
- 2026-02-16: Created initial module context for `blog-site` and documented runtime/config conventions.
